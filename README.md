A RoR site for fetching radar information from the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia, and presenting it in a JSON or HTML format.

This site is currently hosted at: [http://bomradar.herokuapp.com](http://bomradar.herokuapp.com)

Please let me know if you start using this feed, just in case I decide to change the format, urls etc.
